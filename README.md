# PizzaStore
A MEVN Fullstack Webiste for ordering pizza and manageing a pizza/food store.

The website serves the purpose for customers to make an order which gets sent to the database.
Right now the "Menu" and database only consists of pizza but more functionallaty could be added.
The database consists of two models "orders" and "toppings" for the orders.

The code can be used by anyone, also commercially if you want.

This Project was my first try on building a Fullstack WebApp. If you read my code I am open for advice besides the fact that there
are almost no comments. Maybe I will add comments later but for now you have to understand the code by yourself if you found this.
